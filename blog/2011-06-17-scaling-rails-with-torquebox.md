title: 'Scaling Rails Applications with TorqueBox'

Below are video and slides from my _Scaling Rails Applications with
TorqueBox_ presentation given at [JUDCon:2011 Boston][judcon] on May
3rd, 2011. This was my first opportunity to speak at a conference and
I thoroughly enjoyed and learned a lot from it. That's one of the
great things about having a video of the presentation; I see plenty of
things I can improve upon for next time.

Despite my critiques, I feel the talk went well and look forward to
bringing Ruby to more JBoss users and developers at next year's
JUDCon!
