title: Moving From GitHub Pages to Awestruct
---

I'm switching the site over from GitHub Pages to [Awestruct][]. I was
turned on to Awestruct by [Bob McWhirter][] and am really digging the
compass / blueprint integration and ease of writing extensions.

[awestruct]: http://awestruct.org
[bob mcwhirter]: http://bob.mcwhirter.org

As part of the transition, I'm also switching web hosts. It should go
pretty smoothly but because of a poor IntenseDebate implementation on
my old site I'm having a hard time pulling all the previous blog
comments over. There weren't many to begin with, but I apologize in
advance if I can't get them all to show up on the new site.
